# ilusion2
game librtary in java.

With this game library i intend to create games for PC and to be able to run them on raspberry pi 3-B, with support for raspberry GPIO buttons using PI4J.

feel free to use this game library if you want to learn how to create videogames, in fact this is a personal proyect to understand better game development, however i pretend to create my own games using this library.

HOW TO INSTALL

1.- download netbeans IDE and install it
2.- update IDE and download gradle plugin
3.- clone or download this repository into your PC, i suggest put this a folder called Ilusion
( because if you want to run the demos, they have to be in the same folder level )
4.- in netbeans click on open project and select /yourfolders/ilusion2
5.- right click on gradle icon for ilusion2 project and select build
( this will execute gradle build command and will compile the project )


thats all,there are other repository here called ILUSIONGAME, this is a project
containing diferent demos using ilusion2 as dependency also in gradle.

if you found a bug or have any sugestion send me an email to pavulzaval@gmail.com.
